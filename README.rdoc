# usage
There are two models: product that has many components. 
 
Product validates name to include mandatory word *card*. Components that build product can be either *envelope* or *paper*.
 
If one enters some data that are unvalid, only components that are within scopes `papers` or `envelopes` are shown, on either #create or #update actions. Expected behavior would be to show all components in rendered form.
